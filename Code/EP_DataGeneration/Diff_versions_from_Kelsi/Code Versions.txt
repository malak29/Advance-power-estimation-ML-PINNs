Code Versions: Data Generation
Version 1: 
Resolved error running simulations due to excessive path name length. 
Made list of Required_VariableNames. Modified code to run simulations for only these variables, rather than all variables. Decreased number of CSV files generated from several hundred to 35, decreasing simulation time and data required. 

Version 2: 
Resolved bug caused by inconsistent formatting of table headers in the eio output file. (Modified code to use a Category Key List to search for specific tables in the eio output file). 
Resolved DateTime_Split index error caused by inconsistent formatting of the Date/Time column of the csv's generated by the simulation runs. (Creates elif statements to account for variable formatting) 

Version 3: Csv code commented out, created to work on automation
Added nested loops to run code for every building in every location
Fixed bug that occurred due to zone information table including non-thermal zones

Version 4: 
Added code to delete EIO_Dict_Full and the csv files after generation is complete. 
Decreases storage required by getting rid of redundant data.

Version 5:
Added contingency to skip simulation if it's already been completed. 
This will make data generation smoother, as it should be able to pick up where it left off after being interrupted.
